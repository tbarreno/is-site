# InmaSantos' site

This repository contains three projects that make the full site solution.

The site is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and open sourced but
the content is protected by copyright so it can't be publicly shared (some
example content is provided instead).

There's a small *Single Page Application* that acts as an on-line editor for
the authors; it features a front end built on [React](https://reactjs.org/)
and back-end REST services using [Nest](https://nestjs.com/).

## Projects

- '`is-gatsby-site`' - Main site project
- '`is-backend`' - REST services for the on-line content editor
- '`is-editor`' - On-line editor application
